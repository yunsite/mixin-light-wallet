## The differences between Mixin Messenger and Mixin Light Wallet
[Mixin Messenger](https://mixin.one/messenger) is one of popular app for Mixin Network. It's an instant messaging app and also can be used as a wallet to manage the assets on Mixin Network. On the other hand, [Mixin Light](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mixin-light-wallet/fkooimefaedifbjpkinhckcdpmgmihhe) focuses on assets management as a wallet. Mixin doesn't require the users to install an App, doesn't need to register with a phone number. The user of Mixin Light can create as many Mixin accounts as they want. Therefore Mixin Messenger and Mixin Light can be used in different use cases. For example, Mixin Messenger can be used as a chatting app and wallet between friends. Thus Mixin Light can be used anonymously as a cryptocurrency wallet to manage the assets on Mixin Network.

Because Mixin Messenger and Mixin Light Wallet are designed for different use cases. We use the receiver's name (Mixin ID. e.g. `Jake`, `37177549`) to transfer assets within Mixin Messenger. Since Mixin Light Wallet is an anonymous wallet, it doesn't have the receiver's name.  Mixin Light uses the Client ID/User ID(e.g. `7cc3bb10-b297-345c-874e-c02baba60c07`) to transfer. But **we can still transfer the assets between Mixin Messenger and Mixin Light Wallet. And it's instant and free of charge**.  Let's see how.
